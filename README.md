# Pewlett Hackard Analysis
## Overview
### Purpose
The company Pewlett Hackard desires to obtain the number of retiring employees per title. The company would also like to identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. These results will allow Pewlett Hackard to offer retirement packages for those who meet criteria and help the company prepare for the “silver tsunami” as many current employees reach retirement age. 
## Results
### Major Points
* An important result that needed to be generated was the number of retiring employees by job title. To calculate this, I fist retrieved the emp_no, first_name, and last_name columns from the employees table. I retrieved the title, from_date, and to_date columns from the titles table. Then I made a new table, retirement_titles, utilizing the INTO clause. I did an INNER JOIN on both tables using the primary key. I then filtered the data on the birth_date column to retrieve the employees who were born between 1952 and 1955. I made sure to order the table by employee number.

However, there were duplicates entries for some employees that I needed to remove. To do this, I called on the retirement_titles table and utilized the SELECT DISTINCT ON clause on the emp_no column. I then retrieved the emp_no, first_name, last_name, and title columns from the retirement_titles table. I made a new table, unique_titles, utilizing the INTO clause. I flitered the to_date column to keep only the dates equal to January 1, 1999. I then sorted the unique_titles table in ascending order by the employee number and descending order by the last date.

After generating these results, I found that there was a total of 72,458 total employees who were about to retire. This means that Pewlett Hackard will need to fill these spots soon.

* Another important result that needed to be generated was the number of vacant title positions the company would have after their “silver tsunami”. To calculate this, I retrieved the number of titles from the unique_titles table using the COUNT function. I then created a retiring_titles table using the INTO clause to hold the required information. I grouped the table by title and sorted the count column in descending order.

After generating these results, I found that out of the 72,458 total employees who were about to retire, the most vacancies will be in the Senior Engineer position. This is very important for the company to know as they will need to concentrate their resources on hiring senior level engineers.

* The unique_titles table I created generated an additional, important result. It is essential to note that the least vacancies according to job title will be in the Manager position. This is very important for the company to know as they will need to dedicate less resources on hiring managers.
* Another important result that needed to be generated was the number of employees who were eligible to participate in the mentorship program. To find this, I retrieved the emp_no, first_name, last_name, and birth_date columns from the employees table. I retrieved the from_date and to_date columns from the dept_emp table. I then retrieved the title column from the titles table. I utilized a DISTINCT ON statement to retrieve the first occurrence of the employee number for each set of rows defined by the ON () clause. I then used the INTO clause to create a new table, which I named mentorship_eligibility. I then did an INNER JOIN of the employees and the dept_emp tables on the primary key. I similarly conducted an INNER JOIN of the employees and the titles tables on the primary key. I filtered the data on the to_date column to get all the current employees. I then filtered the data on the birth_date columns to get all the employees whose birth dates are between January 1, 1965 and December 31, 1965. I ordered the mentorship_eligibility table by employee number.

Upon generating the table, I found that there were 1,549 total employees eligible to participate in the mentorship program. This is important information for Pewlett Hackard to know as it will help them determine if they need additional mentorship support when their current employees retire.

As of now, there are not enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees. According to the retiring_titles and unique_titles tables that I created in my analysis there will be 72,458 employees about to retire.

### Additional Insights
There are two additional queries that may provide more insight into the upcoming “silver tsunami” in Pewlett Hackard. The first query I’d conduct would be one that shows the breakdown of employees eligible to participate in the mentorship program based on their job title. I can utilize the mentorship_eligibility table and employ the COUNT function on the title column and group by title to retrieve these results. It would be useful for the company to know if there are more potential mentors in certain departments. If one department is lacking an adequate number of mentors, Pewlett Hackard would need to dedicate more resources to that department. The second query I’d create would be one that displays the current employees who are not about to retire but are eligible for promotion. I can utilize the employees table and filter based on company criteria to obtain these results. This would allow Pewlett Hackard to see if the number of high-level positions that need to be filled after the “silver tsunami” decreases. If the company promotes certain employees, then there may be an increase in lower-level positions that need to be filled. This would help them in recruiting and targeting potential employees.
